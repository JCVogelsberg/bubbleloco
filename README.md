Bubble Loco
==========

Just a little game I threw together. Uses CSS-created bubbles, and jQuery to make them resize randomly.

You can play it on my website (http://www.jasonvogelsberg.com/bubbleloco), or download it to your own machine.

To download, download the zip via th link to the right, unzip the file on your computer, and open "index.html" in your web browser.
